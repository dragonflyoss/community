# Dragonfly Community Roles

This directory contains information about the various roles and membership levels within the Dragonfly community. Our community follows a structured approach to governance and participation, with different levels of responsibility and access.

## Role Definitions

The Dragonfly community has several membership levels, each with specific responsibilities and privileges:

### [Members](Members.md)

Community members who have made sustained contributions to the project and are committed to its continued development.

### [Approvers](Approvers.md)

Contributors who have the ability to approve pull requests and are responsible for maintaining code quality in specific areas.

### [Maintainers](Maintainers.md)

Senior contributors who have overall responsibility for the project direction, architecture decisions, and community governance.

### [Security Team](Security-Team.md)

Dedicated team members responsible for handling security issues, vulnerability reports, and security-related communications.

## Subprojects

The Dragonfly community has several subprojects, each with its own maintainers and contributors. [According the governance model](../GOVERNANCE.md#scope), subprojects adhere to the same governance principles as the main project but may simplify some governance processes and roles due to their smaller scale.

### Maintainers
