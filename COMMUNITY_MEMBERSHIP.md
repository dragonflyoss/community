# Dragonfly Community Membership

As a proud member of the CNCF, the Dragonfly project follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

This document explains the responsibilities that come with different contributor roles in the Dragonfly community. Our project is organized into several sub-projects, including (but not limited to) nydus, nydus-snapshotter, api, docs, console, and client. The responsibilities for each role are tied to these specific sub-projects and their repositories.

For a full breakdown of the roles, responsibilities, and qualifications for our community members, please check out our [Contributor Ladder](COMMUNITY_LADDER.md).

## How We Make Decisions

Dragonfly is an open-source project that thrives on transparency. Our repository is the single source of truth for everything—our values, designs, documentation, roadmap, and interfaces.

In short, every decision is made by updating the project. Any change, big or small, that impacts Dragonfly follows these simple steps:

- **Step 1**: Open an issue in the relevant repository to propose a change or raise a concern.
- **Step 2**: Discuss the issue in the comments.
- **Step 3**: Merge or close the issue based on community consensus.

For most issues (excluding those to add new Maintainers):

If we have fewer than seven active Maintainers, an issue can be merged if:

  - At least one active Maintainer comments "LGTM" (Looks Good To Me).
  - No other Maintainers object to the change.

Additionally, when we have fewer than seven active Maintainers, we might use a "lazy consensus period" for significant issues. This means that after an issue gets initial approval, we'll hold it for a set amount of time (like 7 days) to give everyone a final chance to discuss it. If no one objects, it can be closed. If issues come up, we'll resolve the concerns and then proceed and move forward.

## Managing Maintainership

Our Maintainers share the responsibility for the project's success. In general, they:

- Are accountable for the project's outcomes.
- Are invested in the long-term improvement of the project.
- Dedicate time to all the necessary tasks, not just the fun ones.

Maintainers often work hard behind the scenes, and their efforts aren't always visible. While it's easy to get excited about new features, it's just as important—and often more challenging—to handle bug fixes, small improvements, stability optimizations, and all the other foundational work that keeps the project strong.

### Adding New Maintainers

Maintainers start out as dedicated contributors who are committed to the long-term success of the project. If you're aspiring to become a Maintainer, you should be actively involved in resolving issues, contributing code, and reviewing proposals and pull requests for at least two months.

Maintainership is built on trust, and that goes beyond just writing code. You earn the trust of the current Maintainers by consistently acting in the best interest of the project.

New Maintainers are nominated by an existing Maintainer (through a PR) and need a supermajority vote from the current Maintainers to be approved. Similarly, Maintainers can be removed by a supermajority vote, or they can choose to step down by letting any other Maintainer know.

### Removing Inactive Maintainers

An existing Maintainer can be removed from the active list if they are no longer meeting the expectations of the role. If a Maintainer meets one of the following criteria, any other Maintainer can propose their removal through a pull request:

- They haven't participated in community activities for more than three months.
- They have violated the governance rules more than twice.

Once the conditions are confirmed, the Maintainer can be removed, unless they ask to stay and get at least 50% approval from the other Maintainers. If someone is removed, we'll add them to an alumni section in this document to recognize their past contributions.
