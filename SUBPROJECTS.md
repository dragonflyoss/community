# Subprojects

Dragonfly subprojects extend the core functionality of the ecosystem and follow the main project's governance principles.

## Governance

Subprojects adhere to the same community standards as the main project but may have simplified governance processes due to their smaller scale, such as combined roles or streamlined decision-making.

For detailed governance information, see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) and [COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md](COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md).

## Status

The subproject status can be one of the following:

- **Active**: The subproject is actively maintained, with regular updates and community support.
- **Inactive**: The subproject is not actively maintained, for example, no recent commits or issue activity over for a year.
- **Archived**: The subproject is no longer maintained and has been archived for historical reference.

## Workflow

### Establishing

1. **Proposal**: Any community member creates an issue in the [community repository](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/issues) describing the subproject's goals, scope, and potential contributors.

2. **Community Discussion**: Community members discuss feedback on the proposal.

3. **Maintainer Approval**: Maintainers vote with supermajority (65%+) required. See [How we make decisions](COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md#how-we-make-decisions).

4. **Announcement**: Maintainers create repository following [Repository Guidelines](REPOSITORY-GUIDELINES.md) and announce to the community.

### Archiving

When subprojects become inactive or obsolete, they can be archived through the following process:

1. **Proposal**: Any community member creates an issue proposing to archive an inactive or obsolete subproject, including reasons, activity data, and inferred impact.

2. **Community Discussion**: Community members review the proposal and provide feedback.

3. **Maintainer Approval**: After thorough community discussion, maintainers review the proposal and discussion. A supermajority vote (65%+) is required to proceed with archiving. For the decision-making process, see [How we make decisions](COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md#how-we-make-decisions).

4. **Archive**: After approval, the subproject will be archived. Maintainers update repository to archived status and documentation, see [Repository Guidelines](REPOSITORY-GUIDELINES.md#historical-repositories).
