## Goals

We've put this document together with a few key goals in mind:

- To ensure the long-term health and sustainability of the Dragonfly community.
- To encourage new contributors to get more involved and take on formal roles.
- To provide a clear path for those looking to grow into leadership positions.
- To build a strong pipeline of future leaders for the project.

## Scope

This guide covers the roles and responsibilities for everyone who contributes to the Dragonfly open source project and its subprojects and libraries. Whether you're writing code, improving documentation, creating tests, or helping in other ways, this is for you.

## General Guidelines

### Everyone is Welcome

We truly appreciate every contribution. You don't need a formal title to create or review pull requests, help with issues, or join in on discussions. Taking on a formal role is completely optional, so feel free to contribute in any way that works for you.

### Guidance

As described in our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), we welcome all kinds of contributions, whether it's PRs, issues, or new feature ideas. If you're new here, we recommend starting with smaller, meaningful changes. They're easier to review and a great way to get familiar with our processes.

Since we're an open source project, review times can vary depending on when Maintainers and Approvers are available. You can build trust and speed up your progression by making consistent, smaller contributions or by giving constructive feedback on other people's work.

Every time we merge a contribution, we're committing to maintaining it for the long haul. That's why larger changes require not just a lot of effort, but also a proven track record to show the community that you'll be around to support your changes.

Remember, _["no is temporary, yes is forever."](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-design-patterns/9781789135565/3f396314-dac8-446c-ab02-768ae91296fa.xhtml)_ 🙇‍♂️

### Continued Contributions

If you're thinking about applying for one of the roles below, we hope it's because you plan to stay active at that level. If life gets in the way and you can't keep up with the responsibilities of your role, it's perfectly fine to step down. Members who are inactive for an extended period will be removed from the Dragonfly GitHub Organizations, but you can always go through the membership process again when you're ready.

### Consensus for Merging

If you think a change might be controversial, please hold off on merging and give others a chance to share their thoughts. Even if you have merge access, it doesn't mean you should always use it. We want to avoid blocking PRs indefinitely, but it's important to make sure everyone's perspective is heard first.

### Start a Discussion

If you're interested in moving up the ladder and taking on one of these roles, just reach out to a project maintainer on Slack. We're here to help you get started!

## Contributor Ladder

This document lays out the different contributor roles in our open source project, detailing the responsibilities, qualifications, and perks that come with each one.

Contributors usually start at the first level and move up as they become more involved and make a bigger impact. We're here to support you every step of the way as you climb the contributor ladder!

Our ladder has four main roles: **Contributor**, **Member**, **Approver**, and **Maintainer**. Each role comes with its own set of responsibilities, qualifications, and privileges that reflect a contributor's level of involvement and the trust they've earned in the community.

Here's a quick look at the roles:
