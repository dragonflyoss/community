## Contributor Ladder

This document defines the contributor roles within our open source project, outlining the responsibilities, qualifications, and privileges associated with each role.

Contributors typically start at the base level and progress as their engagement and impact on the project grow. We encourage and support your journey up the contributor ladder!

Each role is described with three key aspects:

- Responsibilities: Tasks and duties expected at this level.
- Qualifications: Criteria or requirements to achieve this role.
- Privileges: Rights and benefits granted to contributors at this level.

Roles and responsibilities may evolve as the project grows. The final decision on role assignments rests with the project Committers.

## General Guidance on Contributions and Expectations

We welcome contributions in the form of PRs, issues, and feature proposals. For new contributors, starting with small, meaningful changes is recommended. These are easier to review and help you understand the project‚Äôs processes and expectations.

As an open source project, response times for reviews may vary due to the availability of Committers and Approvers. Building trust through consistent, smaller contributions or constructive feedback on others‚Äô work can accelerate recognition and progression.

Every merged contribution commits the project to long-term maintenance. As such, larger changes require not only effort but also a proven track record to assure the community of your ongoing support for maintaining those changes.
