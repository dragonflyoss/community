# Meeting Skip Notice

## Reason for Skipping
The maintainer meeting scheduled for today has been skipped due to conflicting scheduling commitments from key participants who had other mandatory meetings at the same time slot.

## Next Meeting
The next maintainer meeting will be held on **August 26, 2025** at the regular time slot, assuming no further conflicts arise. The topics for the next meeting can be found and proposed via the [link](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/issues/66).

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and look forward to having all maintainers present for our next scheduled session.
