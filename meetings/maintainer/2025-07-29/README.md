## Topics

### Introduction of new community roles and responsibilities @mingcheng

The introduction of new community roles and responsibilities aims to enhance collaboration and streamline contributions within the Dragonfly community. By clearly defining roles, we can ensure that all members understand their responsibilities and can work together more effectively.

Update the community roles and responsibilities document to reflect the latest changes and expectations for each role. This will help new members onboard quickly and existing members to align with the community's goals.

For more details, please refer to the following links:

- https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md
- https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/COMMUNITY_LADDER.md
- https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/blob/master/ROADMAP.md

The following step is migrating the main repository related documents to the community repository. This will ensure that all community-related information is centralized and easily accessible to all members.

### Dragonfly Graduation Proposal @mingcheng @gaius-qi

The Dragonfly Graduation Proposal is a significant step towards the project's maturity. Last week, we submitted the proposal to the Kenvin for pre-review. The Kevin has provided feedback, and we are currently working on optimizing the proposal based on his suggestions.

We plan to submit the final version of the proposal and application document by weekend, and complete the review and merge in next month.

### Perform the first maintainer election @chlins

The first maintainer election is scheduled for the next days. This election was performed in accordance with our community's new governance model and confirmed its efficiency. All community members are encouraged to participate in the election process.
