# Release Procedure

This document outlines the release procedure for Dragonfly, including the steps to prepare for a release, the release process itself.
The goal is to ensure a smooth and efficient release process while maintaining high quality and stability in the software.

## Overview

Dragonfly is built and released to Github using [Go Releaser](https://goreleaser.com/). Go Releaser will run in the CI/CD pipeline and create
the release artifacts, including binaries, Docker images, and other necessary files which provide a hermetic environment that prevents build
contamination from the host environment.

## Prepare Environment

1. Install [git-chglog](https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog) to generate the changelog for the minor and patch releases.
2. Install [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) to run the pre-commit hooks for the release process.
3. Install [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) to generate the documentation for the helm chart.

## Create Release

### Create New Major Release

To create a new major release, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new tag from release branch**: Create a new tag from the release branch (e.g., `v3.0.0`) using the following command:

   Clone the `dragonfly` repository.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:dragonflyoss/dragonfly.git
   cd dragonfly
   ```

   Create a new tag from the release branch.

   ```bash
   git checkout release-3.0
   git tag v3.0.0
   ```

2. **Update the version in `version.go`**: Update the go version in `version.go` file.

   ```go
   hack/update-version-gorelease.sh
   ```

3. **Generate the ChangeLog**: Generate the changelog using the following command:

   ```bash
   make changelog
   ```

4. **Push the tag**: Push the tag to the remote repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git push origin v3.0.0
   ```

5. **Wait for the CI/CD pipeline**: Wait for the CI/CD pipeline to complete. The pipeline will create the release artifacts, including binaries, Docker images, and other necessary files.

Release pipeline will be triggered automatically when a new tag is pushed to the repository and release pipeline is configured in the `.github/workflows/release.yml` file.
Release pipeline link is <https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/actions/workflows/release.yml>, wait for the pipeline to complete and check the logs for any errors.
If the pipeline finished, it will create a new release in the GitHub repository with the tag name and release notes.

6. **Create a new release**: Create a new release in the GitHub repository following the steps below:

Enter the [release page](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/releases) in the GitHub repository, and click the "edit" button to add the release notes
and release the new version. Major release should not use the `git-chglog` to generate the release notes and need to be manually edited.
