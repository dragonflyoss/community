# Dragonfly Community

Dragonfly, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation(CNCF) project, is committed to
build an open, inclusive, productive and self-governing open source community.
Dragonfly community has a mandate to facilitate driving neutral consensus for:

- defining Dragonfly's evolving direction to meet CNCF end-users' demand;
- self-governing Dragonfly project among all kinds of participants;
- facilitating community participants achieving success on technical vision;

## Community Meetings

Dragonfly community meetings are scheduled on an ad-hoc basis as needed.
To propose agenda items for a potential meeting, please open an issue in the relevant
Dragonfly GitHub repository (e.g., [dragonflyoss/community issues](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/issues) for
general community topics, or a specific project repository for project-specific discussions).
If there is sufficient interest or a clear need for broader discussion on proposed items, a meeting will be scheduled.
Details and announcements for scheduled meetings will be made through appropriate
channels (e.g., the relevant GitHub issue, mailing lists, or community communication platforms).

### Typical Meeting Agenda (when a meeting is scheduled)

When a meeting is held, the agenda will be based on the proposed items and typically includes:

- Focused discussion on the specific agenda items that prompted the meeting.
- Group discussion on design reviews, code reviews, or other technical topics as needed.
- A brief sync-up on relevant project or community status, if applicable.
- Planning for any next steps or actions arising from the discussion.
- An opportunity for open discussion on other brief topics if time permits.
