# Dragonfly Community

Welcome to the Dragonfly community! We are committed to building an open, inclusive, productive, and self‑governing open‑source community.

## Community Meetings

Dragonfly community meetings are held every two weeks (bi-weekly).
To propose agenda items for a potential meeting, please open an issue in the relevant
Dragonfly GitHub repository (e.g., [dragonflyoss/community issues](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/community/issues) for
general community topics, or a specific project repository for project-specific discussions).

### Meeting Agenda

When a meeting is held, the agenda will be based on the proposed items and typically includes:

- Focused discussion on the specific agenda items that prompted the meeting.
- Group discussion on design reviews, code reviews, or other technical topics as needed.
- A brief sync-up on relevant project or community status, if applicable.
- Planning for any next steps or actions arising from the discussion.
- An opportunity for open discussion on other brief topics if time permits.
