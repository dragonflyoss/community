# Dragonfly Project Governance

The Dragonfly project is committed to open and transparent governance to foster a healthy, inclusive, and effective community. This governance document outlines the project's roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes. Our goal is to keep it concise and practical, ensuring all contributors and users can clearly understand how the project operates.

## Core Principles

- **Openness**: We welcome contributions of all kinds. Communication and decision-making should be open and transparent.
- **Inclusivity**: We strive to create a friendly environment where contributors from diverse backgrounds can participate.
- **Neutrality**: The project is community-driven. Decisions should be based on technical merit and community consensus, not on the interests of specific companies or individuals.
- **Simplicity**: Governance processes aim to be straightforward and avoid unnecessary complexity.
