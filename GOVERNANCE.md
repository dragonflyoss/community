# Dragonfly Project Governance

Welcome to the Dragonfly project's governance guide! We believe in open and transparent collaboration to build a healthy, inclusive, and effective community. This document explains how our project is run, including our roles, responsibilities, and how we make decisions. We've aimed to keep things simple and practical so everyone can easily understand how to get involved and how the project operates.

## Core Principles

- **Openness**: We welcome all kinds of contributions! All our communication and decision-making are done openly and transparently.
- **Inclusivity**: We're committed to creating a friendly and welcoming environment where people from all backgrounds can participate and feel included.
- **Neutrality**: As a community-driven project, our decisions are based on technical merit and community consensus, free from the influence of any single company or individual.
- **Simplicity**: We keep our governance processes as straightforward as possible, avoiding unnecessary red tape.

## Scope

This governance document applies to the Dragonfly project and all its subprojects or libraries, including but not limited to [Nydus](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/nydus), nydus-snapshotter, api, docs, console, and client.

These subprojects and libraries may have their own maintainers and contributors, but they all adhere to the overarching principles and practices established by the Dragonfly community.

Note: Due to the smaller scale of these subprojects and libraries, some governance processes and roles may be simplified.

For more about our subprojects governance, please refer to the [Subprojects Governance](SUBPROJECTS.md) document.
